# Week5 — Quiz1

**1) Why is it beneficial for services in a cloud-based system to be stateless?**

A. Stateless services are easier to program and require less code.
B. They can be easily replicated, run in parallel, and moved between virtual servers to handle scaling.
C. They are the only type of service that can communicate using Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based protocols.
D. They maintain a persistent, in-memory copy of the user's session, which improves performance.

**2) What was a significant problem with the "Web Services" standards (e.g., Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Web Services Description Language (WSDL)) from the early 2000s?**

A. They were too simple and did not support complex business logic.
B. They could only be written in one programming language.
C. They involved large, complex Extensible Markup Language (XML) messages that were slow to analyze and had high overhead.
D. They did not have a standard for interface description.

**3) What key insight, pioneered by companies like Amazon, helped define the modern microservice?**

A. Services should be completely independent, with their own database and their own user interface.
B. All services in a system should share a single, highly optimized database to reduce complexity.
C. Services should focus only on technical tasks, while a central monolith handles all business logic.
D. A service should be related to multiple business functions to be efficient.

**5) Why is low coupling an important characteristic for microservices?**

A. It ensures that all services can be written in the same programming language.
B. It allows you to update a service (while maintaining its interface) without having to change other services in the system.
C. It minimizes the number of functions inside a single service, making the code simpler.
D. It forces all services to share a single, common database, which simplifies data management.

**6) When determining the appropriate "size" for a microservice, what guideline does the author suggest?**

A. The service's code should not exceed a strict limit, such as 500 lines of code.
B. The service should be small enough to be developed, tested, and deployed by a team in two weeks or less.
C. The service must encapsulate at least five related business functions to be considered a "microservice."
D. The service should be large enough to handle a complete, end-to-end business workflow (e.g., user registration).

**7) What is the "common closure principle" guideline for decomposing a system?**

A. All services that are part of the same business capability should be grouped together.
B. Elements of a system that are likely to be changed at the same time should be located within the same service.
C. All services should be "closed" for modification but "open" for extension.
D. Services should be decomposed based on the data they manage, not their function.

**8) What is the "orchestration" approach to service coordination?**

A. Services communicate by publishing events that other services subscribe to, with no central controller.
B. A separate controller service (the "conductor") executes the workflow by calling component services in a specific order.
C. All services share a central database, which orchestrates the workflow using Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (ACID) transactions.
D. Services directly call each other in a peer-to-peer mesh, negotiating the workflow steps as they go.

**9) What is a "compensating transaction"?**

A. A transaction that bundles all data updates into a single unit to guarantee consistency.
B. A transaction that reverses a previous operation when a failure is detected in a dependent service.
C. A log of all pending updates used to ensure "eventual consistency" between service replicas.
D. A special transaction used by a circuit breaker to test if a failed service has recovered.

**10) How does the "choreography" approach to service coordination work?**

A. A central controller dictates the exact order of operations for all services.
B. Each service emits an event to indicate it has completed processing, and other services react to those events.
C. The Application Programming Interface (API) gateway is responsible for coordinating all service workflows.
D. Services use synchronous, direct calls to coordinate their actions in real-time.

**11) Why is the "circuit breaker" pattern often preferred over simple timeouts for managing external service failures?**

A. A circuit breaker encrypts the service request, making it more secure.
B. A circuit breaker immediately denies access to a failed service without waiting for the timeout, preventing system slowdown.
C. A circuit breaker automatically retries the request dozens of times until the service responds.
D. A circuit breaker automatically scales up a new instance of the failed service.
