**2) What is the core principle of "continuous deployment"?**

**4) In the continuous deployment pipeline, what is the primary purpose of a "container" (e.g., Docker)?**

A. To act as a virtual server that includes a full operating system.
B. To be a virtualized environment (deployment unit) that includes all the software and dependencies that a service needs to run.
C. To run the automated unit tests before building the system.
D. To monitor the service for failures after it has been deployed.

**5) What is the role of a container management system like Kubernetes?**

B. It is a tool for writing and running automated unit tests.
C. It automates container deployment and management, handling scheduling, load balancing, and service discovery.
D. It is a type of Application Programming Interface (API) gateway used to route traffic to different service versions.

**7) How can a system using an Application Programming Interface (API) gateway safely manage a "rollback" if a newly deployed service version fails?**

A. The API gateway automatically deletes the failed service container and rebuilds the old one from source code.
B. The system maintains the old version, and if the monitor detects a problem, it simply switches the "current version link" back to the older service.
C. All client applications are forced to update their URIs to point to the older service version.
D. The system blocks all new requests, forcing them to time out until a developer manually fixes the bug in the new version.

**8) When a service's API must change, how can the system support both old and new clients?**

A. By forcing all client services to update at the exact same time.
B. By including the version number as part of the resource's Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
C. By deploying the new service on a completely different server domain.
D. By using a "compensating transaction" to automatically translate new API calls to the old format.

**9) What is the purpose of a numbering convention like changing a service version from 001 to 101?**

A. To indicate a minor bug fix that does not change the API.
B. To signal to the API gateway that this service should be deployed in a container.
C. To identify whether a new version has introduced an API change.
D. To show that the service is now managed by a different development team.
